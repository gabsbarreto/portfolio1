## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

    ## ℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:
    ## 
    ## # Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)
    ## 
    ## # Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)
    ## 
    ## # Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))
    ## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was
    ## generated.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

``` r
(ggplot(data = FULLDATA2, aes(x = coffeetea, y = LBXGLT)) +
  geom_point())
```

    ## Warning: Removed 39341 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
